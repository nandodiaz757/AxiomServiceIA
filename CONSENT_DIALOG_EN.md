AxiomQA is a professional tool for QA teams and app owners. To analyze and compare changes in your app's user interface (UI), AxiomQA needs permission to access Accessibility Services.

**What will be captured:**
- The structure of your app's UI (buttons, text, images, layouts)
- Accessibility properties (labels, hints, enabled/disabled states)
- The order and hierarchy of UI components

**What will NOT be captured:**
- Personal user data (names, emails, passwords, credit card numbers)
- Any content entered by users in forms or text fields
- Any data outside the app's UI structure

Your data will be securely transmitted and stored for analysis purposes only. You can revoke this permission at any time by disabling Accessibility Service or uninstalling the app.
